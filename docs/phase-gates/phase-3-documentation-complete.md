## Documentation Inventory

- Product framing and parity scope
  - `docs/feature-matrix.md`
  - `docs/product-theme.md`
- Implementation architecture
  - `docs/implementation-plan.md`
  - `docs/next-milestones.md`
- Governance and guardrails
  - `docs/guardrails-adoption.md`
  - `docs/review-teams.md`
  - `.guardrails/pre-work-check.md`
  - `.guardrails/team-layout-rules.json`
- Security and contributor policy
  - `SECURITY.md`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Gate records
  - `docs/phase-gates/phase-1-gate-report.md`
  - `docs/phase-gates/phase-2-gate-report.md`
  - `docs/phase-gates/phase-3-gate-report.md`

## Outcome

- Documentation coverage is sufficient for build-squad gate transition and reviewer onboarding.
- Remaining advanced docs (runbooks, incident playbooks, production deployment guides) are deferred to later phases.
